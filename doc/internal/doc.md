**Special documentation pages**

These pages are Markdown files stuck in ;;'s documentation folder.
They contain detailed information about things that aren't exactly
cogs or command, and are supposed to be useful.

Those files are written in Discord Markdown, with the following
coming from normal Markdown:

```markdown
No newline displayed
at the end of a line.··
Unless there are two spaces at the end.

Or two newlines.
```
